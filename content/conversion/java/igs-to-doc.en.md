    title: "About GroupDocs.Conversion for Java API"
    content: |
        [GroupDocs.Conversion for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/java/) is an advanced file format conversion API for converting between popular image and document formats such as Microsoft Office, OpenDocument, PDF, HTML, email, CAD. and much more with just a few lines of code. The native API automatically detects the formats of the original documents and offers many options for customizing the converted documents. Along with the function of extracting information from a document, it also supports caching of the conversion results to the local disk by default. However, any type of cache storage can be supported by implementing the appropriate interfaces - Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, Windows Azure, Reddis, or any others.

        Convert your IGS files to DOC in Java. It only takes a couple of lines of Java code on any platform of your choice, such as Windows, Linux, macOS.
        You can try converting IGS to DOC for free and evaluate the quality of the conversion results. Along with simple file conversion scripts, you can try more sophisticated options for loading the IGS source file and storing the DOC output. 
        
        For example, for the source IGS file you may use the following load options:

        * automatic detection of the file format;
        * specify a password for protected files (if the file format supports it);
        * replace missing fonts to preserve the appearance of the document.
        
        There are also advanced convert options for the DOC file:

        * convert a specific page of a document or a range of pages;
        * add a watermark to the converted DOC.

        Once the conversion is complete, you can save the DOC file to your local file path or to any third party storage such as FTP, Amazon S3, Google Drive, Dropbox etc. Please note - to convert IGS to DOC, you do not need to install any additional software, such as MS Office, Open Office, Adobe Acrobat Reader etc.
