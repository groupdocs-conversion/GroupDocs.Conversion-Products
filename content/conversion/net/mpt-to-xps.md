          content: |
            Files with .mpt extension are Microsoft Project template files. These contain basic information and structure along with document settings for creating MPP files. Such a template file offers default settings such as schedule or budget information for a particular project. It, however, can not save project-related data such as tasks, resources, or assignments. Once modified, the template files can be saved as standard MPP files for further working with it.

          title: " About XPS File Format"
          content: |
            An XPS file represents page layout files that are based on XML Paper Specifications created by Microsoft. This format was developed by Microsoft as replacement of EMF file format and is similar to PDF file format, but uses XML in layout, appearance, and printing information of a document. It is, in fact, more justified to say that XPS is an attempt on PDF, but couldn't get enough popularity as owned by PDF for a number of reasons.
