          content: |
            Files with VSDM extension are drawing files created with Microsoft Visio application that supports macros. VSDM files are OPC/XML drawings that are similar to VSDX but also provide the capability to run macros when the file is opened. Macros are user-defined actions/steps that are developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and can be used to perform repetitive tasks.

          content: |
            Files with DOTX extension are template files created by Microsoft Word to have pre-formatted settings for a generation of further DOCX files. A template file is created in order to have specific user settings that should be applied to subsequent files created from this template. These settings include page margins, borders, headers, footers, and other page settings. Such templates are used in official documents such as company letterheads and standardized forms.
