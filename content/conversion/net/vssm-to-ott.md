          content: |
            Files with .VSSM extension are Microsoft Visio Stencil files that support provide support for macros. A VSSM file when opened allows running the macros to achieve the desired formatting and placement of shapes in a diagram. In general, Microsoft Visio is drawing software that allows creating files that can contain and represent user-defined information in different shapes.

            Files with OTT extension represent template documents generated by applications in compliance with the OASIS' OpenDocument standard format. These are created with word processor applications such as free OpenOffice Writer and can hold settings that can be used to generate new documents from these template files. These settings include page margins, borders, headers, footers, and other page settings. Such templates are used in official documents such as company letterheads and standardized forms.
