          content: |
            A file with .cf2 extension is a CAD file format that contains 3D package designs or other model data for die cutting. Most of the CAD/CAM machines can process and cut these files. It was created by the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) to provide self-describing data storage and manipulation format that matches the structure of scientific data and applications such as statistical and numerical methods, visualization and management. With the passage of time, multiple hardware devices and software applications have been developed that recognize .cf2 files. These applications provide support for CF2 files on Mac OS and Windows Operating Systems.

          title: " About CSV File Format"
          content: |
            Files with CSV (Comma Separated Values) extension represent plain text files that contain records of data with comma separated values. Each line in a CSV file is a new record from the set of records contained in the file. Such files are generated when data transfer is intended from one storage system to another. Since all applications can recognize records separated by comma, import of such data files to database is done very conveniently. Almost all spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc can import CSV without much effort. Data imported from such files is arranged in cells of a spreadsheet for representation to user.
