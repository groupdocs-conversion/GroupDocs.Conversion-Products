            An image file format is a standard method for organizing and storing images on devices like computers, tablets and smartphones. Digital images store image data in 2-dimensional grid of pixels where each pixel is a representation of colour in terms of number of bits. Image file types are classified into vector image formats and raster image formats. 3D Images are another type of vector image file format that is used for managing 3D images.
