          content: |
            A file with .jpf extension is an extension to the JPEG 2000 image coding system ISO/IEC 15444 and is referred to as its Part 2 ISO/IEC 15444-2. It defines and specifies a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, grey-scale, colour digital still images, or multi-component images. The first part of ISO/IEC 15444-1 is referred to the JP2 that uses the wavelet technology to code lossless content and is the base for JPEG 2000 image file formats. The JPF file format didn’t receive a warm reception due to the extensive usage of JPEG format. JPG files can be opened with popular imaging applications such as Adobe Photoshop 2020, Adobe Illustrator 2020, and CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020.

It is similar to DOCX file format but the ability to run macros makes it different from DOCX. Like DOCX, DOCM files can be store text, images, tables, shapes, charts and other contents.The capability to run macros make it easy to save time by executing the series of commands in the form of recorded actions for automatic completion of a task. DOCM files can be opened and edited in Microsoft Word 2007 and above.
