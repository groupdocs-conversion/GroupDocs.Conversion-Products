          content: |
            Files with .mpt extension are Microsoft Project template files. These contain basic information and structure along with document settings for creating .MPP files. Such a template file offers default settings such as schedule or budget information for a particular project. It, however, can not save project related data such as tasks, resources or assignments. Once modified, the template files can be saved as standard MPP file for further working with it. Microsoft Project comes with a master template file named "Global.mpt" that is opened when a new template file is to be created. MPT files use application/vnd.ms-project and application/x-project as standard MIME types. MPT files can be opened with Moos Project Viewer, Microsoft Project, and MPXJ programs on Windows, Linux and MacOS platforms.

          content: |
            A file with .wmz extension is a compressed version of WMF and is used to store metafiles. It is an intermediate level file generated by older versions of Microsoft Office applications and is not very popularly used. WMZ files are generated while saving documents to HTML format. These may also be generated while emailing documents that contain embedded clip art, equations, etc. Applications that can open WMZ files include (but not limited to) Corel Winzip and Apple Archive Utility.
