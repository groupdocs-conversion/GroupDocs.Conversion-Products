          content: |
            Files with PPTM extension are Macro-enabled Presentation files that are created with Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 or higher versions. They are similar to PPTX files with the difference that the lateral can't execute macros though they can contain macros. PPTM files can be edited by opening them in Microsoft PowerPoint and updating the contents. Another similar format is PPSM but it is read-only by default and starts the slideshow when opened. PPTM, like PPTX, contains slides for different presentation elements like text, images, videos, graphs and other related material.

          title: " About WMZ File Format"
          content: |
            A file with .wmz extension is a compressed version of WMF and is used to store metafiles. It is an intermediate level file generated by older versions of Microsoft Office applications and is not very popularly used. WMZ files are generated while saving documents to HTML format. These may also be generated while emailing documents that contain embedded clip art, equations, etc. Applications that can open WMZ files include (but not limited to) Corel Winzip and Apple Archive Utility.
