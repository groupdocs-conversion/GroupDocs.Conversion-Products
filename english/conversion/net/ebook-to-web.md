          content: |
            Files with .epub extension are an e-book file format that provide a standard digital publication format for publishers and consumers. The format has been so common by now that it is supported by many e-readers and software applications. For example, on Mac OS, the pre-installed Books software provides the support for opening such files. In addition, there are a lot of compatible software available for smartphones, tablets and computers. EPUB file standards are maintained by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). The version EPUB 3 is also endorsed by the Book Industry Study Group (BISG), a leading book trade association for standardized best practices, research, information and events, for packaging of content.

            It takes a number of file types when building a webpage. Web file formats define the standards for development of webpages and are related to platform in which these are built. A complete website can be built consisting of static as well as dynamic webpages. Most modern websites are built on server side technology such as Active Server Pages (ASP) that are loaded and run on the web server. These also include cascading styling sheets (CSS) and scripting files used for the styling the overall look and feel of UI. Common web file extensions and their associate file formats include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), ASP (Active Server Pages), and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
