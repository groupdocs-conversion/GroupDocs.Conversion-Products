            A spreadsheet file contains data in the form of rows and columns. You can open, view and edit such files using spreadsheet software applications such as Microsoft Excel that is now available for both Windows and MacOS operating system. Similarly, Google sheets is a free online spreadsheet creating and editing tool that works from any web browser. A spreadsheet file can be saved in several different file formats, each having a different file extension for unique representation. Data is stored in cells either in plain form such as text string, numbers, date, currency, etc. or as formulas that change a cellâ€™s value when referenced cell values change. Common spreadsheet file extensions and their file formats include XLSX (Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet), ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) and XLS (Microsoft Excel Binary File Format).

          title: " About PDF File Format"
          content: |
            Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
