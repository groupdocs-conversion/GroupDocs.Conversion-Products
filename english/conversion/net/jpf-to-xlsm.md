            A file with .jpf extension is an extension to the JPEG 2000 image coding system ISO/IEC 15444 and is referred to as its Part 2 ISO/IEC 15444-2. It defines and specifies a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, grey-scale, colour digital still images, or multi-component images. The first part of ISO/IEC 15444-1 is referred to the JP2 that uses the wavelet technology to code lossless content and is the base for JPEG 2000 image file formats. The JPF file format didn’t receive a warm reception due to the extensive usage of JPEG format. JPG files can be opened with popular imaging applications such as Adobe Photoshop 2020, Adobe Illustrator 2020, and CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020.

            Files with XLSM extension is a type of Spreasheet files that support Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there.
