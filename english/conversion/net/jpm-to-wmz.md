          content: |
            JPM refers to JPEG 2000 image coding system Part 6 which is used for document imaging. It is based on the Mixed Raster Content Standard (ISO/IEC 16485) and contains layered still images that use JPEG 2000 and other encodings. In addition to its own specifications, JPM file format inherits features from its parent i.e. the jp2 file format.

          content: |
            A file with .wmz extension is a compressed version of WMF and is used to store metafiles. It is an intermediate level file generated by older versions of Microsoft Office applications and is not very popularly used. WMZ files are generated while saving documents to HTML format. These may also be generated while emailing documents that contain embedded clip art, equations, etc. Applications that can open WMZ files include (but not limited to) Corel Winzip and Apple Archive Utility.
