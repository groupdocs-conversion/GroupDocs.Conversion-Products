            A file with MPP extension is Microsoft Project data file that stores information related to project management in an integrated manner. It is proprietary file format developed by Microsoft as file format for Microsoft Project (MSP) which is a project management application software. Besides MPP, MSP supports other file formats as well like project XML schema. Several APIs and applications provide the facility to convert MPP file format to others. Microsoft now has online Project Server where project management files can be uploaded for collaboration by multiple users.

          content: |
            A file with .emz extension is a compressed container of Enhanced Metafile (EML file). These are compressed using the GZIP compression technique which is the commonly used compression method on UNIX and LINUX operating systems. Unlink ZIP (/compression/zip/), GZIP compresses the archive as a whole instead of compressing individual files. EMZ files are smaller in size as compared to the EMF files and help in fast transfer during online file sharing. Some of the applications that can open EMZ files include Microsoft Visio 2019, Microsoft Office 2019, XnView MP, and File Viewer Plus.
