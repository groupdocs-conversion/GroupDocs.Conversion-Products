            MPP and other similar files are Project file formats that are created by Project Management software such as Microsoft Project. A project file is a collection of tasks, resources, and their scheduling to get a measurable output in the form or a product or a service. Gantt charts are used to establish a visual flow of activities against time for the identified tasks that can also be exported to PDF or image formats for documentation. Primavera P6 is another Project Management Software by Oracle that provides complete project planning.

          content: |
            SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability.
