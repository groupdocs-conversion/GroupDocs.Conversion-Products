    title: "About GroupDocs.Conversion for Java API"
    content: |
        [GroupDocs.Conversion for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/java/) is an advanced file format conversion API for converting between popular image and document formats such as Microsoft Office, OpenDocument, PDF, HTML, email, CAD. and much more with just a few lines of code. The native API automatically detects the formats of the original documents and offers many options for customizing the converted documents. Along with the function of extracting information from a document, it also supports caching of the conversion results to the local disk by default. However, any type of cache storage can be supported by implementing the appropriate interfaces - Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, Windows Azure, Reddis, or any others.
