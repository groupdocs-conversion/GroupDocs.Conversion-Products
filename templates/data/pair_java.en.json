The native API automatically detects the formats of the original documents and offers many options for customizing the converted documents. Along with the function of extracting information from a document, it also supports caching of the conversion results to the local disk by default. However, any type of cache storage can be supported by implementing the appropriate interfaces - Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, Windows Azure, Reddis, or any others."
